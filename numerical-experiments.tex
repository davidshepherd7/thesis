\chapter{Numerical experiments with magnetic nanotubes}
\label{cha:numer-experiments}

In this section we apply the complete FEM/BEM scheme with adaptive IMR and nodal integration, as developed in \crefs{sec:galerk-meth-llg, sec:hybr-finit-elem, sec:adaptive-imr}, to the problem of magnetisation dynamics in a nanotube.
