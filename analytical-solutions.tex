\section{Analytical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation}

When testing numerical solvers for differential equations it is very
helpful to be able to check the results against analytical solutions for
some special cases. This section contains some solutions useful for this
purpose.
Unfortunately it appears to be very difficult to find solutions to the LLG equation with exchange coupling (i.e. spatially dependant/spatially non-constant).

\subsection{Solution due to Mallinson}

In a 2000 paper\cite{Mallinson2000} Mallinson gives an analytical equation for the time taken for magnetisation to ``switch'' from one polar angle (angle to the field axis) to another.
He also gives the azimuthal angle (the angle around the field axis) rotated through during this switching.

The conditions for this model to apply are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Constant applied field.
\item No exchange field.
\item Uniaxial anisotropy.
\item Magnetostatic field (prolate ellipsoidal particles only).
\item All effective fields must lie along the same axis.
\end{enumerate}

Let $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ be the starting and endingangles between the field axis and the magnetisation (i.e. polar angles). Let $H_k$ be the combined anisotropy field: $H_k = \frac{2 K}{M_s} + M_s(N_\perp - N_\parallel)$ where $N$ is the demagnetisation tensor of the ellipsoid. All other symbols have their usual meanings. Then the time taken to switch from $\theta_1$ to $\theta_2$ is

\begin{equation}
  \tau = \frac{\dampc^2 +1}{\gymagc \dampc} \frac{1}{H^2 - H_k^2}
  \left[ H \ln \left( \frac{\tan(\theta_2/2)}{\tan(\theta_1/2)} \right)
       + H_k \ln \left( \frac{H - H_k \cos\theta_1}{H - H_k \cos\theta_2} \right)
       + H_k \ln \left( \frac{\sin\theta_2}{\sin\theta_1} \right)
    \right].
\end{equation}

The azimuthal angle precessed through during this switching is
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \frac{-1}{\dampc} \ln \left( \frac{\tan(\theta_2/2)}{\tan(\theta_1/2)} \right).
\end{equation}

Note that this is not really a true ``solution'' to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
It gives the switching time and azimuthal angle as a function of polar angle rather than the magnetisation direction as a function of time.

\subsection{Solution due to ??ds}

A similar solution has been given by ... for the case when the field is applied at a right angle to the easy axis.

\subsection{Solution with exchange}

It turns out to be possible to write down a solution to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation even with the exchange term included as long as the physical boundary condition ??ds is ignored.

??ds don't remember the solution...
