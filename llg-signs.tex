\label{sec:note-signs-llg}

In the recent republication of Gilbert's derivation (in his thesis) of the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation he gives the following equivalent equations:
\begin{equation}
  \pd{\Mv}{t} = - |\gamma| \Mv \times \big[ \Hv - \eta \pd{\Mv}{t} \big],
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \pd{\Mv}{t} = - |\gamma| \Mv \times \Hv - \frac{\alpha}{M_s} \Mv \times \pd{\Mv}{t}.
  \label{eq:llg-vedamping}
\end{equation}
Where $\alpha = \eta \gamma M_s$ and $\gamma < 0$. However the sign of $\eta$ is not given, hence the sign of $\alpha$ is not certain. Conventionally the sign of $\alpha$ is positive. However since Gilbert's paper was probably the first to use that constant he may have used a different convention.

Another potential source of confusion is the sign of $\gamma$. Physically the gyromagnetic constant for an electron is negative. However some authors use $\gamma$ to represent $|\gamma|$, thus reversing some signs.

However some more recent sources\cite{Fidler2000}\cite{nmag-manual}\cite{Lopez-Diaz2012} give
\begin{equation}
  \pd{\Mv}{t} = - |\gamma| \Mv \times \Hv + \frac{\alpha}{M_s} \Mv \times \pd{\Mv}{t},
  \label{eq:llg+vedamping}
\end{equation}

note the opposite sign on the second term. I think this discrepancy is due to opposite conventions in the sign of $\alpha$.

Hence we will use equation \eqref{eq:llg+vedamping}.

Note however that there are other recent papers using different signs so I am still not entirely sure which is correct.
