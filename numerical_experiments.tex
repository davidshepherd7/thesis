\chapter{Numerical experiments with magnetic nanotubes}
\label{cha:numer-experiments}

In this section we apply the complete FEM/BEM scheme with adaptive IMR and nodal integration, as developed in \autorefs{sec:galerk-meth-llg, sec:hybr-finit-elem, sec:adaptive-imr, sec:aimr-llg, sec:nodal-integration}, to the problem of magnetisation dynamics in a nanotube.
