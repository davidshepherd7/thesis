abstract = {Some useful formulas are developed to evaluate integrals having a singularity of the form (t-x) sup-m, m greater than or equal 1. Interpreting the integrals with strong singularities in Hadamard sense, the results are used to obtain approximate solutions of singular integral equations. A mixed boundary value problem from the theory of elasticity is considered as an example. Particularly for integral equations where the kernel contains, in addition to the dominant term (t-x) sup-m, terms which become unbounded at the end points, the present technique appears to be extremely effective to obtain rapidly converging numerical results.},

@article{Mankovsky2013,
abstract = {A method for the calculations of the Gilbert damping parameter $\alpha$ is presented, which based on the linear response formalism, has been implemented within the fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker band structure method in combination with the coherent potential approximation alloy theory. To account for thermal displacements of atoms as a scattering mechanism, an alloy-analogy model is introduced. This allows the determination of $\alpha$ for various types of materials, such as elemental magnetic systems and ordered magnetic compounds at finite temperature, as well as for disordered magnetic alloys at $T = 0$ K and above. The effects of spin-orbit coupling, chemical and temperature induced structural disorder are analyzed. Calculations have been performed for the 3$d$ transition-metals bcc Fe, hcp Co, and fcc Ni, their binary alloys bcc Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$, fcc Ni$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$, fcc Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$ and bcc Fe$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$, and for 5d impurities in transition-metal alloys. All results are in satisfying agreement with experiment.},

@article{Borghetti2010,
abstract = {The authors of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors-the industry consensus set of goals established for advancing silicon integrated circuit technology-have challenged the computing research community to find new physical state variables (other than charge or voltage), new devices, and new architectures that offer memory and logic functions beyond those available with standard transistors. Recently, ultra-dense resistive memory arrays built from various two-terminal semiconductor or insulator thin film devices have been demonstrated. Among these, bipolar voltage-actuated switches have been identified as physical realizations of 'memristors' or memristive devices, combining the electrical properties of a memory element and a resistor. Such devices were first hypothesized by Chua in 1971 (ref. 15), and are characterized by one or more state variables that define the resistance of the switch depending upon its voltage history. Here we show that this family of nonlinear dynamical memory devices can also be used for logic operations: we demonstrate that they can execute material implication (IMP), which is a fundamental Boolean logic operation on two variables p and q such that pIMPq is equivalent to (NOTp)ORq. Incorporated within an appropriate circuit, memristive switches can thus perform 'stateful' logic operations for which the same devices serve simultaneously as gates (logic) and latches (memory) that use resistance instead of voltage or charge as the physical state variable.},

@article{Das2011,
abstract = {Science and technology in the electronics area have always been driven by the development of materials with unique properties and their integration into novel device concepts with the ultimate goal to enable new functionalities in innovative circuit architectures. In particular, a shift in paradigm requires a synergistic approach that combines materials, devices and circuit aspects simultaneously. Here we report the experimental implementation of a novel nonvolatile memory cell that combines silicon nanowires with an organic ferroelectric polymer-PVDF-TrFE-into a new ferroelectric transistor architecture. Our new cell, the ferroelectric transistor random access memory (FeTRAM) exhibits similarities with state-of-the-art ferroelectric random access memories (FeRAMs) in that it utilizes a ferroelectric material to store information in a nonvolatile (NV) fashion but with the added advantage of allowing for nondestructive readout. This nondestructive readout is a result of information being stored in our cell using a ferroelectric transistor instead of a capacitor-the scheme commonly employed in conventional FeRAMs.},

@article{Richardson2011,
abstract = {In recent decades, there have been many attempts to construct symplectic integrators with variable time steps, with rather disappointing results. In this paper we identify the causes for this lack of performance, and find that they fall into two categories. In the first, the time step is considered a function of time alone, \Delta=\Delta(t). In this case, backwards error analysis shows that while the algorithms remain symplectic, parametric instabilities arise because of resonance between oscillations of \Delta(t) and the orbital motion. In the second category the time step is a function of phase space variables \Delta=\Delta(q,p). In this case, the system of equations to be solved is analyzed by introducing a new time variable \tau with dt=\Delta(q,p) d\tau. The transformed equations are no longer in Hamiltonian form, and thus are not guaranteed to be stable even when integrated using a method which is symplectic for constant \Delta. We analyze two methods for integrating the transformed equations which do, however, preserve the structure of the original equations. The first is an extended phase space method, which has been successfully used in previous studies of adaptive time step symplectic integrators. The second, novel, method is based on a non-canonical mixed-variable generating function. Numerical trials for both of these methods show good results, without parametric instabilities or spurious growth or damping. It is then shown how to adapt the time step to an error estimate found by backward error analysis, in order to optimize the time-stepping scheme. Numerical results are obtained using this formulation and compared with other time-stepping schemes for the extended phase space symplectic method.},

These guys used quadratic basis instead.
        
It appears to be more accurate for unstructured meshes, presumably because it uses a "proper" Galerkin finite element method representation.
        
Except that they still use a box method! The accuracy could have been improved by the fact that they are using some very high order test functions (5th order).},

abstract = {We have developed a finite-element micromagnetic simulation code based on the FEniCS package called magnum.fe. Here we describe the numerical methods that are applied as well as their implementation with FEniCS. We apply a transformation method for the solution of the demagnetization-field problem. A semi-implicit weak formulation is used for the integration of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Numerical experiments show the validity of simulation results. magnum.fe is open source and well documented. The broad feature range of the FEniCS package makes magnum.fe a good choice for the implementation of novel micromagnetic finite-element algorithms.},

@article{Schinwald2012,
abstract = {Graphene is a new nanomaterial with unusual and useful physical and chemical properties. However, in the form of nanoplatelets this new, emerging material could pose unusual risks to the respiratory system after inhalation exposure. The graphene-based nanoplatelets used in this study are commercially available and consist of several sheets of graphene (few-layer graphene). We first derived the respirability of graphene nanoplatelets (GP) from the basic principles of the aerodynamic behavior of plate-shaped particles which allowed us to calculate their aerodynamic diameter. This showed that the nanoplatelets, which were up to 25 $\mu$m in diameter, were respirable and so would deposit beyond the ciliated airways following inhalation. We therefore utilized models of pharyngeal aspiration and direct intrapleural installation of GP, as well as an in vitro model, to assess their inflammatory potential. These large but respirable GP were inflammogenic in both the lung and the pleural space. MIP-1$\alpha$, MCP-1, MIP-2, IL-8, and IL-1$\beta$ expression in the BAL, the pleural lavage, and cell culture supernatant from THP-1 macrophages were increased with GP exposure compared to controls but not with nanoparticulate carbon black (CB). In vitro, macrophages exposed to GP showed expression of IL-1$\beta$. This study highlights the importance of nanoplatelet form as a driver for in vivo and in vitro inflammogenicity by virtue of their respirable aerodynamic diameter, despite a considerable 2-dimensional size which leads to frustrated phagocytosis when they deposit in the distal lungs and macrophages attempt to phagocytose them. Our data suggest that nanoplatelets pose a novel nanohazard and structure-toxicity relationship in nanoparticle toxicology.},

@article{Sampaio2013,
abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable spin configurations, which usually originate from chiral interactions known as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Skyrmion lattices were initially observed in bulk non-centrosymmetric crystals, but have more recently been noted in ultrathin films, where their existence is explained by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced by the proximity to an adjacent layer with strong spin-orbit coupling. Skyrmions are promising candidates as information carriers for future information-processing devices due to their small size (down to a few nanometres) and to the very small current densities needed to displace skyrmion lattices. However, any practical application will probably require the creation, manipulation and detection of isolated skyrmions in magnetic thin-film nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate by numerical investigations that an isolated skyrmion can be a stable configuration in a nanostructure, can be locally nucleated by injection of spin-polarized current, and can be displaced by current-induced spin torques, even in the presence of large defects.},

@article{Wang2012,
abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2)), have been shown to exhibit excellent electrical and optical properties. The semiconducting nature of MoS(2) allows it to overcome the shortcomings of zero-bandgap graphene, while still sharing many of graphene's advantages for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Discrete electronic and optoelectronic components, such as field-effect transistors, sensors, and photodetectors made from few-layer MoS(2) show promising performance as potential substitute of Si in conventional electronics and of organic and amorphous Si semiconductors in ubiquitous systems and display applications. An important next step is the fabrication of fully integrated multistage circuits and logic building blocks on MoS(2) to demonstrate its capability for complex digital logic and high-frequency ac applications. This paper demonstrates an inverter, a NAND gate, a static random access memory, and a five-stage ring oscillator based on a direct-coupled transistor logic technology. The circuits comprise between 2 to 12 transistors seamlessly integrated side-by-side on a single sheet of bilayer MoS(2). Both enhancement-mode and depletion-mode transistors were fabricated thanks to the use of gate metals with different work functions.},

abstract = {For a boundary integral formulation of the 2D Laplace equation with mixed boundary conditions, we consider an adaptive Galerkin BEM based on an [Formula: see text]-type error estimator. We include the resolution of the Dirichlet, Neumann, and volume data into the adaptive algorithm. In particular, an implementation of the developed algorithm has only to deal with discrete integral operators. We prove that the proposed adaptive scheme leads to a sequence of discrete solutions, for which the corresponding error estimators tend to zero. Under a saturation assumption for the non-perturbed problem which is observed empirically, the sequence of discrete solutions thus converges to the exact solution in the energy norm.},

The two regions are coupled by means of their strayfield and the combined system is solved by an optimized time integration scheme.},

@article{Mendil2014,
abstract = {Magnetization manipulation is essential for basic research and applications. A fundamental question is, how fast can the magnetization be reversed in nanoscale magnetic storage media. When subject to an ultrafast laser pulse, the speed of the magnetization dynamics depends on the nature of the energy transfer pathway. The order of the spin system can be effectively influenced through spin-flip processes mediated by hot electrons. It has been predicted that as electrons drive spins into the regime close to almost total demagnetization, characterized by a loss of ferromagnetic correlations near criticality, a second slower demagnetization process takes place after the initial fast drop of magnetization. By studying FePt, we unravel the fundamental role of the electronic structure. As the ferromagnet Fe becomes more noble in the FePt compound, the electronic structure is changed and the density of states around the Fermi level is reduced, thereby driving the spin correlations into the limit of critical fluctuations.

@article{Yang2011,
abstract = {We fabricated bit-patterned media (BPM) at densities as high as 3.3 Tbit/in(2) using a process consisting of high-resolution electron-beam lithography followed directly by magnetic film deposition. By avoiding pattern transfer processes such as etching and liftoff that inherently reduce pattern fidelity, the resolution of the final pattern was kept close to that of the lithographic step. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) showed magnetic isolation of the patterned bits at 1.9 Tbit/in(2), which was close to the resolution limit of the MFM. The method presented will enable studies on magnetic bits packed at ultra-high densities, and can be combined with other scalable patterning methods such as templated self-assembly and nanoimprint lithography for high-volume manufacturing.},

Its high performance and low memory requirements allow for large-scale simulations to be performed in limited time and on inexpensive hardware. We verified each part of the software by comparing results to analytical values where available and to micromagnetic standard problems. mumax3 also offers specific extensions like MFM image generation, moving simulation window, edge charge removal and material grains.},

abstract = {We have studied the electron transport behavior of electrochemically gated graphene transistors in different solutions. In an ionic liquid, we have determined the electron and hole carrier densities and estimated the concentration of charged impurities to be (1-10) x 10(12) cm(-2). The minimum conductivity displays an exponential decrease with the density of charged impurities, which is attributed to the impurity scattering of the carriers. In aqueous solutions, the position of minimum conductivity shifts negatively as the ionic concentration increases. The dependence of the transport properties on ionic concentration is important for biosensor applications, and the observation is modeled in terms of screening for impurity charges by the ions in solutions.},

@article{Jarvinen2013,
abstract = {One of the suggested ways of controlling the electronic properties of graphene is to establish a periodic potential modulation on it, which could be achieved by self-assembly of ordered molecular lattices. We have studied the self-assembly of cobalt phthalocyanines (CoPc) on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene transferred onto silicon dioxide (SiO2) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates. Our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments show that, on both substrates, CoPc forms a square lattice. However, on SiO2, the domain size is limited by the corrugation of graphene, whereas on h-BN, single domain extends over entire terraces of the underlying h-BN. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements suggest that CoPc molecules are doped by the substrate and that the level of doping varies from molecule to molecule. This variation is larger on graphene on SiO2 than on h-BN. These results suggest that graphene on h-BN is an ideal substrate for the study of molecular self-assembly toward controlling the electronic properties of graphene by engineered potential landscapes.},

abstract = {A chemical approach to modify the electronic transport of graphene is investigated by detailed transport and Raman spectroscopy measurements on Hall bar shaped samples. The functionalization of graphene with nitrobenzene diazonium ions results in a strong p-doping of the graphene samples and only slightly lower mobilities. Comparing Raman and transport data taken after each functionalization step allowed the conclusion that two preferential reactions take place on the graphene surface. In the beginning a few nitrobenzene molecules are directly attached to the graphene atoms creating defects. Afterwards these act as seeds for a polymer like growth not directly connected to the graphene atoms. The effects of solvents were excluded by thorough control measurements.},

@article{Lee2004,
abstract = {The possibility of exciting microwave oscillations in a nanomagnet by a spin-polarized current, as predicted by Slonczewski and Berger, has recently been demonstrated. This observation opens important prospects of applications in radiofrequency components. However, some unresolved inconsistencies are found when interpreting the magnetization dynamics within the coherent spin-torque model. In some cases, the telegraph noise caused by spin-currents could not be quantitatively described by that model. This has led to controversy about the need for an effective magnetic temperature model. Here we interpret the experimental results of Kiselev et al. using micromagnetic simulations. We point out the key role played by incoherent spin-wave excitation due to spin-transfer torque. The incoherence is caused by spatial inhomogeneities in local fields generating distributions of local precession frequencies. We observe telegraph noise with gigahertz frequencies at zero temperature. This is a consequence of the chaotic dynamics and is associated with transitions between attraction wells in phase space.},

Using spin transfer torque underneath a nanocontact on a magnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), we have observed the generation of dissipative magnetic droplet solitons and report on their rich dynamical properties. Micromagnetic simulations identify a wide range of automodulation frequencies, including droplet oscillatory motion, droplet "spinning," and droplet "breather" states. The droplet can be controlled by using both current and magnetic fields and is expected to have applications in spintronics, magnonics, and PMA-based domain-wall devices.},

Understanding the scaling behavior of this new nanomaterial under common experimental conditions is of critical importance for developing graphene-based nanoscale devices. We present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study on the influence of edge disorder and bulk disorder on the minimum conductivity of graphene ribbons. For the first time, we discovered a strong nonmonotonic size scaling behavior featuring a peak and saturation minimum conductivity. Through extensive numerical simulations and analysis, we are able to attribute these features to the amount of edge and bulk disorder in graphene devices. This study elucidates the quantum transport mechanisms in realistic experimental graphene systems, which can be used as a guideline for designing graphene-based nanoscale devices with improved performance.},

@article{Liu2011,
abstract = {Integrated optical modulators with high modulation speed, small footprint and large optical bandwidth are poised to be the enabling devices for on-chip optical interconnects. Semiconductor modulators have therefore been heavily researched over the past few years. However, the device footprint of silicon-based modulators is of the order of millimetres, owing to its weak electro-optical properties. Germanium and compound semiconductors, on the other hand, face the major challenge of integration with existing silicon electronics and photonics platforms. Integrating silicon modulators with high-quality-factor optical resonators increases the modulation strength, but these devices suffer from intrinsic narrow bandwidth and require sophisticated optical design; they also have stringent fabrication requirements and limited temperature tolerances. Finding a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible material with adequate modulation speed and strength has therefore become a task of not only scientific interest, but also industrial importance. Here we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, high-speed, waveguide-integrated electroabsorption modulator based on monolayer graphene. By electrically tuning the Fermi level of the graphene sheet, we demonstrate modulation of the guided light at frequencies over 1 GHz, together with a broad operation spectrum that ranges from 1.35 to 1.6 µm under ambient conditions. The high modulation efficiency of graphene results in an active device area of merely 25 µm(2), which is among the smallest to date. This graphene-based optical modulation mechanism, with combined advantages of compact footprint, low operation voltage and ultrafast modulation speed across a broad range of wavelengths, can enable novel architectures for on-chip optical communications.},

abstract = {Scattering mechanisms in graphene are critical to understanding the limits of signal-to-noise ratios of unsuspended graphene devices. Here we present the four-probe low-frequency noise (1/f) characteristics in back-gated single layer graphene (SLG) and bilayer graphene (BLG) samples. Contrary to the expected noise increase with the resistance, the noise for SLG decreases near the Dirac point, possibly due to the effects of the spatial charge inhomogeneity. For BLG, a similar noise reduction near the Dirac point is observed, but with a different gate dependence of its noise behavior. Some possible reasons for the different noise behavior between SLG and BLG are discussed.},

abstract = {The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation is a fascinating nonlinear evolution equation both from mathematical and physical points of view. It is related to the dynamics of several important physical systems such as ferromagnets, vortex filaments, moving space curves, etc. and has intimate connections with many of the well-known integrable soliton equations, including nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger and sine-Gordon equations. It can admit very many dynamical structures including spin waves, elliptic function waves, solitons, dromions, vortices, spatio-temporal patterns, chaos, etc. depending on the physical and spin dimensions and the nature of interactions. An exciting recent development is that the spin torque effect in nanoferromagnets is described by a generalization of the LLG equation that forms a basic dynamical equation in the field of spintronics. This article will briefly review these developments as a tribute to Robin Bullough who was a great admirer of the LLG equation.},

abstract = {We propose new semi-implicit numerical methods for the integration of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation with built-in angular momentum conservation. The performance of the proposed integrators is tested on the 1D Heisenberg chain. For this system, our schemes show better stability properties and allow us to use considerably larger time steps than standard explicit methods. At the same time, these semi-implicit schemes are also of comparable accuracy to and computationally much cheaper than the standard midpoint implicit method. The results are of key importance for atomistic spin dynamics simulations and the study of spin dynamics beyond the macro spin approximation.},

abstract = {Only very recently, Sayas [The validity of Johnson-N\'{e}d\'{e}lec's BEM-FEM coupling on polygonal interfaces. SIAM J Numer Anal 2009;47:3451-63] proved that the Johnson-N\'{e}d\'{e}lec one-equation approach from [On the coupling of boundary integral and finite element methods. Math Comput 1980;35:1063-79] provides a stable coupling of finite element method (FEM) and boundary element method (BEM). In our work, we now adapt the analytical results for different a posteriori error estimates developed for the symmetric FEM-BEM coupling to the Johnson-N\'{e}d\'{e}lec coupling. More precisely, we analyze the weighted-residual error estimator, the two-level error estimator, and different versions of (h-h/2)-based error estimators. In numerical experiments, we use these estimators to steer h-adaptive algorithms, and compare the effectivity of the different approaches.},

@article{Sabareesan2011,
abstract = {Precessional magnetization switching in ferromagnetic nanofilms such as permalloy (Py), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) of 5 nm thickness with magnetic surface anisotropy (MSA) is investigated analytically in the presence of a magnetic field. When the strength of the applied magnetic field is increased beyond a threshold value, the time taken for reversing the magnetization in the above films decreases steadily. Among the films, Py requires the lowest magnetic field (3.98 kA m( - 1)) to reverse the magnetization and Co needs the largest (21.49 kA m( - 1)). Further, the time taken to reverse magnetization in Py film (06.46 ps) is far less than the reversal time in the case of Fe film (16.74 ps). It is found that MSA reduces the switching time significantly. Among the different films, Py is identified as a good candidate for use in ferromagnetic devices due to its energy efficient character.},
