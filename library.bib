abstract = {Some useful formulas are developed to evaluate integrals having a singularity of the form (t-x) sup-m, m greater than or equal 1. Interpreting the integrals with strong singularities in Hadamard sense, the results are used to obtain approximate solutions of singular integral equations. A mixed boundary value problem from the theory of elasticity is considered as an example. Particularly for integral equations where the kernel contains, in addition to the dominant term (t-x) sup-m, terms which become unbounded at the end points, the present technique appears to be extremely effective to obtain rapidly converging numerical results.},

In particular, a shift in paradigm requires a synergistic approach that combines materials, devices and circuit aspects simultaneously. Here we report the experimental implementation of a novel nonvolatile memory cell that combines silicon nanowires with an organic ferroelectric polymer-PVDF-TrFE-into a new ferroelectric transistor architecture. Our new cell, the ferroelectric transistor random access memory (FeTRAM) exhibits similarities with state-of-the-art ferroelectric random access memories (FeRAMs) in that it utilizes a ferroelectric material to store information in a nonvolatile (NV) fashion but with the added advantage of allowing for nondestructive readout. This nondestructive readout is a result of information being stored in our cell using a ferroelectric transistor instead of a capacitor-the scheme commonly employed in conventional FeRAMs.},

abstract = {We fabricated bit-patterned media (BPM) at densities as high as 3.3 Tbit/in(2) using a process consisting of high-resolution electron-beam lithography followed directly by magnetic film deposition. By avoiding pattern transfer processes such as etching and liftoff that inherently reduce pattern fidelity, the resolution of the final pattern was kept close to that of the lithographic step. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) showed magnetic isolation of the patterned bits at 1.9 Tbit/in(2), which was close to the resolution limit of the MFM. The method presented will enable studies on magnetic bits packed at ultra-high densities, and can be combined with other scalable patterning methods such as templated self-assembly and nanoimprint lithography for high-volume manufacturing.},

abstract = {We have studied the electron transport behavior of electrochemically gated graphene transistors in different solutions. In an ionic liquid, we have determined the electron and hole carrier densities and estimated the concentration of charged impurities to be (1-10) x 10(12) cm(-2). The minimum conductivity displays an exponential decrease with the density of charged impurities, which is attributed to the impurity scattering of the carriers. In aqueous solutions, the position of minimum conductivity shifts negatively as the ionic concentration increases. The dependence of the transport properties on ionic concentration is important for biosensor applications, and the observation is modeled in terms of screening for impurity charges by the ions in solutions.},

The functionalization of graphene with nitrobenzene diazonium ions results in a strong p-doping of the graphene samples and only slightly lower mobilities. Comparing Raman and transport data taken after each functionalization step allowed the conclusion that two preferential reactions take place on the graphene surface. In the beginning a few nitrobenzene molecules are directly attached to the graphene atoms creating defects. Afterwards these act as seeds for a polymer like growth not directly connected to the graphene atoms. The effects of solvents were excluded by thorough control measurements.},

@article{Richardson2011,
abstract = {In recent decades, there have been many attempts to construct symplectic integrators with variable time steps, with rather disappointing results. In this paper we identify the causes for this lack of performance, and find that they fall into two categories. In the first, the time step is considered a function of time alone, $\Delta=\Delta(t)$. In this case, backwards error analysis shows that while the algorithms remain symplectic, parametric instabilities arise because of resonance between oscillations of $\Delta(t)$ and the orbital motion. In the second category the time step is a function of phase space variables $\Delta=\Delta(q,p)$. In this case, the system of equations to be solved is analyzed by introducing a new time variable $\tau$ with $dt=\Delta(q,p) d\tau$. The transformed equations are no longer in Hamiltonian form, and thus are not guaranteed to be stable even when integrated using a method which is symplectic for constant $\Delta$. We analyze two methods for integrating the transformed equations which do, however, preserve the structure of the original equations. The first is an extended phase space method, which has been successfully used in previous studies of adaptive time step symplectic integrators. The second, novel, method is based on a non-canonical mixed-variable generating function. Numerical trials for both of these methods show good results, without parametric instabilities or spurious growth or damping. It is then shown how to adapt the time step to an error estimate found by backward error analysis, in order to optimize the time-stepping scheme. Numerical results are obtained using this formulation and compared with other time-stepping schemes for the extended phase space symplectic method.},

@article{Liu2011,
abstract = {Integrated optical modulators with high modulation speed, small footprint and large optical bandwidth are poised to be the enabling devices for on-chip optical interconnects. Semiconductor modulators have therefore been heavily researched over the past few years. However, the device footprint of silicon-based modulators is of the order of millimetres, owing to its weak electro-optical properties. Germanium and compound semiconductors, on the other hand, face the major challenge of integration with existing silicon electronics and photonics platforms. Integrating silicon modulators with high-quality-factor optical resonators increases the modulation strength, but these devices suffer from intrinsic narrow bandwidth and require sophisticated optical design; they also have stringent fabrication requirements and limited temperature tolerances. Finding a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible material with adequate modulation speed and strength has therefore become a task of not only scientific interest, but also industrial importance. Here we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, high-speed, waveguide-integrated electroabsorption modulator based on monolayer graphene. By electrically tuning the Fermi level of the graphene sheet, we demonstrate modulation of the guided light at frequencies over 1 GHz, together with a broad operation spectrum that ranges from 1.35 to 1.6 µm under ambient conditions. The high modulation efficiency of graphene results in an active device area of merely 25 µm(2), which is among the smallest to date. This graphene-based optical modulation mechanism, with combined advantages of compact footprint, low operation voltage and ultrafast modulation speed across a broad range of wavelengths, can enable novel architectures for on-chip optical communications.},

@article{Borghetti2010,
abstract = {The authors of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors-the industry consensus set of goals established for advancing silicon integrated circuit technology-have challenged the computing research community to find new physical state variables (other than charge or voltage), new devices, and new architectures that offer memory and logic functions beyond those available with standard transistors. Recently, ultra-dense resistive memory arrays built from various two-terminal semiconductor or insulator thin film devices have been demonstrated. Among these, bipolar voltage-actuated switches have been identified as physical realizations of 'memristors' or memristive devices, combining the electrical properties of a memory element and a resistor. Such devices were first hypothesized by Chua in 1971 (ref. 15), and are characterized by one or more state variables that define the resistance of the switch depending upon its voltage history. Here we show that this family of nonlinear dynamical memory devices can also be used for logic operations: we demonstrate that they can execute material implication (IMP), which is a fundamental Boolean logic operation on two variables p and q such that pIMPq is equivalent to (NOTp)ORq. Incorporated within an appropriate circuit, memristive switches can thus perform 'stateful' logic operations for which the same devices serve simultaneously as gates (logic) and latches (memory) that use resistance instead of voltage or charge as the physical state variable.},

abstract = {Scattering mechanisms in graphene are critical to understanding the limits of signal-to-noise ratios of unsuspended graphene devices. Here we present the four-probe low-frequency noise (1/f) characteristics in back-gated single layer graphene (SLG) and bilayer graphene (BLG) samples. Contrary to the expected noise increase with the resistance, the noise for SLG decreases near the Dirac point, possibly due to the effects of the spatial charge inhomogeneity. For BLG, a similar noise reduction near the Dirac point is observed, but with a different gate dependence of its noise behavior. Some possible reasons for the different noise behavior between SLG and BLG are discussed.},

Understanding the scaling behavior of this new nanomaterial under common experimental conditions is of critical importance for developing graphene-based nanoscale devices. We present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study on the influence of edge disorder and bulk disorder on the minimum conductivity of graphene ribbons. For the first time, we discovered a strong nonmonotonic size scaling behavior featuring a peak and saturation minimum conductivity. Through extensive numerical simulations and analysis, we are able to attribute these features to the amount of edge and bulk disorder in graphene devices. This study elucidates the quantum transport mechanisms in realistic experimental graphene systems, which can be used as a guideline for designing graphene-based nanoscale devices with improved performance.},

These guys used quadratic basis instead.


It appears to be more accurate for unstructured meshes, presumably because it uses a "proper" Galerkin finite element method representation.


Except that they still use a box method! The accuracy could have been improved by the fact that they are using some very high order test functions (5th order).},

@article{Wang2012,
abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2)), have been shown to exhibit excellent electrical and optical properties. The semiconducting nature of MoS(2) allows it to overcome the shortcomings of zero-bandgap graphene, while still sharing many of graphene's advantages for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Discrete electronic and optoelectronic components, such as field-effect transistors, sensors, and photodetectors made from few-layer MoS(2) show promising performance as potential substitute of Si in conventional electronics and of organic and amorphous Si semiconductors in ubiquitous systems and display applications. An important next step is the fabrication of fully integrated multistage circuits and logic building blocks on MoS(2) to demonstrate its capability for complex digital logic and high-frequency ac applications. This paper demonstrates an inverter, a NAND gate, a static random access memory, and a five-stage ring oscillator based on a direct-coupled transistor logic technology. The circuits comprise between 2 to 12 transistors seamlessly integrated side-by-side on a single sheet of bilayer MoS(2). Both enhancement-mode and depletion-mode transistors were fabricated thanks to the use of gate metals with different work functions.},

A semi-implicit weak formulation is used for the integration of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Numerical experiments show the validity of simulation results. magnum.fe is open source and well documented. The broad feature range of the FEniCS package makes magnum.fe a good choice for the implementation of novel micromagnetic finite-element algorithms.},

@article{Yuk2012,
abstract = {We introduce a new type of liquid cell for in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) based on entrapment of a liquid film between layers of graphene. The graphene liquid cell facilitates atomic-level resolution imaging while sustaining the most realistic liquid conditions achievable under electron-beam radiation. We employ this cell to explore the mechanism of colloidal platinum nanocrystal growth. Direct atomic-resolution imaging allows us to visualize critical steps in the process, including site-selective coalescence, structural reshaping after coalescence, and surface faceting.},
