* Write first drafts 
** Conclusion
** Abstract

** Acknowledgements
*** Supervisors
*** Ray
*** Family
*** open source micromagnetics code: magpar + nmag


* Generate pretty images
** Cube
** wave solution
** mumag4 initial state
** mumag4 as required by specification
** Update illustation in FEM section

* Run computations
** mumag4 with 0 damping for energy conservation


* Write code
** Very simple scipy script for nodal quadrature on triangles
show that |m| conseravation fails for a very simple case

code should go in an appendix + results in thesis
